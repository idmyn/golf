# Untitled Golf Game

A golf game built by [David Mynors](https://github.com/idmyn) and [Tim Golding](https://github.com/tgolding55) during the project week of the JavaScript module at [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/career-courses/coding-bootcamp/london).
The physics is handled by [Matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/), [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) is used to enable communication between browsers and the server, the stying utilises [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), and in the backend we used [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).
